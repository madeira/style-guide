#Coding style

##Spacing

*Use soft-tabs with a two space indent. Spaces are the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any person's environment.
*Put spaces after : in property declarations.
*Put spaces before { in rule declarations.
*Put line breaks between rulesets.
*When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
*Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
*Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.

##Formatting

*Use hex color codes #000 unless using rgba().
*Use // for comment blocks (instead of /* */).
*Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., margin: 0; instead of margin: 0px;.
*Strive to limit use of shorthand declarations to instances where you must explicitly set all the available values.
